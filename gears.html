                <h3>Bat</h3>
                <p>
                    Cricket bat is a  equipment used by batsmen to hit the ball. It is made up of wood and has handle to hold, a face of blade to hit the ball and sides to separate
                    back and blade. Acoording to ICC rules, the dimensions should not exceed in 96.5 cm in length, 10.8 cm in width and 0.89 cm in thickness
                </p>

                <h3>Ball</h3>
                <p>In cricket, the ball is made from three layers, first layer is made up of cork taken from oak tree, then it is tightly wounded by strings, and ultimately covered by a leather case with a slightly raised sewn seam. According to international standards, ball should have circumference within 22.4 cm and 22.9 cm range. However weight of ball is 155.9 g to 163 g for men and 140 g to 151 g.</p>

                <h3>Wickets</h3>
                <p>Wickets are placed at both sides of pitch opposite to each other. A Wicket consists of three wooden stumps and two wooden bails resting on top of them. It should be 22.86 cm (9 inches) wide and 71.1 cm (28 inches tall). A batsman guard the wickets, if ball passes the defense of batsman and hit the wickets and bails on them falls then batsman can no longer play in that innings.</p>

                <p>Lord's tips and advice for buying protective equipment</p>

                <h4>Helmet</h4>
                <p>it is worn on head to protect head from the ball which is very hard. It's covers the whole head and has a grill to protect ears and mouth. It is often worn by batsmen, wicket-keeper and fielders who stand very close to pitch i.e. Fielder on silly point or silly mid on.</p>

                <h4>Gloves</h4>
                <p>Thickly padded fibre is used in gloves to protect hand from bowl that may hit batsman's hand. It covers whole hand and used to easily grip the bat. Gloves are also worn by wicket-keeper to easily catch the ball without hurting the figures.</p>

                <h4>Guards</h4>
                <p>There are various types of guards available such as thigh guards, abdominal guards, arm guards to protect various body parts in case ball misses the bat and hits on body. Some of these guards are also worn by fielders and wicket keeper.</p>

                <h4>Pads</h4>
                <p>There are always a high risk of ball hitting batsman's legs, so to protect the legs pads are used. Pads are made up of cotton and foam and they are designed to minimise the impact of ball on legs. They are worn by batsmen and wicketkeeper. However, wicket-keeper's pads are little short to prevent interference with agility.</p>
