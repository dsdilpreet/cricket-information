                    Organised by International Cricket Council, it started in 1998 as a knockout championship which was held after every two years. Over time the
                    pattern changed and now it is played between top 8 eight international teams every four years. It is based on one day cricket format and is most
                    important cricket tournament after world cup. Two pools of four teams are formed and each team plays two matches in group stage. Top two teams
                    from each group are advanced to knockout stage of semi finals. Final match is played between winnings teams of semi finals. It is a short tournament
                    because every team can only play two matches in group stage, so elimination is almost certain if a team loses a match.
